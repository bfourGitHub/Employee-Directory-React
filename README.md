# Employee-Directory-React
Unit 19 React Assignment. UW Coding Boot Camp.


## Overview

For this assignment, you'll create a employee directory with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

This assignment presented new challenges. One of the biggest hurdles was connecting actions on the frontend to code on the backend. This assignment provided useful practice for utilizing props as well as more practice with integrating/using APIs. 

Through trial and error I was able to add functionality for sorting employees by first and last name in either ascending or descending order (A-Z or Z-A). Adding click events and placement of props and such was the most tricky part of this process. Adding a few styling touches makes the app look a bit more polished.


## Table of Contents

* [User Story](#user-story)
* [Acceptance Criteria](#acceptance-criteria)
* [Questions](#questions)
* [Deployment](#deployment)

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

* An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.



## Acceptance Criteria

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
